      <description>What is this? This is an experimental approach to blogging. Rather than us choosing topics; we search around for questions out in the wild, (say Stack Overflow or other chat sites) which are surprisingl difficult to answer in a QA format and try to answer them in as detailed as we can.
We hope to write up technical responses that may be more detailed than the original question hoped or cared for, but perhaps may entertain other curious passer-bys on the wider internet.</description>
