      <description>Q: &amp;ldquo;Unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, they have many nodes, so the network is safe. but Hyperledger are permissioned distributed ledgers, does that mean less nodes in this network and less security?&amp;rdquo;
A: Number of nodes does not impact security in Hyperledger Fabric.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the question. Based on the context where the question was found, Hyperledger here means Hyperledger Fabric.
I&amp;rsquo;ll assume basic knowledge of Bitcoin/Ethereum and continue from there.</description>

      <description>Q: &amp;ldquo;does blockchain fork happen in fabric??&amp;rdquo;
A: No.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the question. Blockchain fork is not one of the most cleanly defined terms out there, but let us go with the meaning of forks in Bitcoin blockchain. Fabrc on it&amp;rsquo;s own is supposed to mean &amp;ldquo;Hyperledger Fabric&amp;rdquo; which is the official term for the project. Link to the project site.
At this point, I am going to assume passing familiarity of Hyperledger Fabric and Bitcoin and continue from there.</description>

      <title>What Is This?</title>

      <description>What is this? This is an experimental approach to blogging. Rather than us choosing topics; we search around for questions out in the wild, (say Stack Overflow or other chat sites) which are surprisingly difficult to answer in a QA format and try to answer them in as detailed as we can.
We hope to write up technical responses that may be more detailed than the original question hoped or cared for, but perhaps may entertain other curious passer-bys on the wider internet.</description>
